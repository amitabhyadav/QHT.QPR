    "#### What?\n",

    "Given $A\\vec x = \\vec b$ for a Matrix $A$ and vector $\\vec b$, solve for $\\vec x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ is Hermitian matrix i.e. $A = A^\\dagger$. $A$ must be sparse and low-rank.\n",

    "We have to represent $\\vec x$ and $\\vec b$ as quantum states, $|x\\rangle$ and $|b\\rangle$. So, we normalize them, i.e. $|x| = |b| = 1$\n",

    "#### Now what?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to solve $A|x\\rangle = |b\\rangle$ for $|x\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can rewrite, $|x\\rangle = \\frac{A^{-1}|b\\rangle}{|A^{-1}|b\\rangle|}$"

    "Find the expectation value of some operator $M$ with $\\vec x$ i.e. $\\vec x M \\vec x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operator here is typically the Pauli operators X,Y,Z. The quantum computer returns us the answer in probabilities of measurement which can be translated to get expectation values with respect to operators.\n",

    "Let {$|u_{j}\\rangle$} be the eigenbasis of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let {$\\lambda_j$} be the eigenvalues of $A$. Scale the eigenvalues such that, 0 < $\\lambda_j$ < 1.\n",
